##  **Introduction**

AEOLUM is the first Variable Font built using experimental tools like SYFF (Synthetic Font Functions), marketed using a web experience powered by ThreeJS and Web3 and funded by minting NFTs and your Sponsorships. Proving a viable for designers way to develop variable fonts.

### **Phase Introduction**
<sub>Introduction / Phase Introduction</sub>

<br>


For the sake of simplicity we will only present the following phases:

* Initiation Phase
* Planning Phase

### **Initiation Phase**

*  **Initiation Phase** Components ∞0.001:
	
	1.  **Business Case**:
		*  Strategic case 
		*  Management case

### **Business Case**
<sub>Introduction / Phase Introduction / Initiation Phase / Business Case</sub>

<br>



#### We want to manage and fund and market the development of AEOLUM by using web3 technologies.

We see NFTs as both a funding and an access mechanism to our marketing material experience. A user or client can receive our design products directly without contribution to our funding. In the mean time we attempt to create a immersive experience for the ones who do participate in funding our Typography Department (TYDE). The 3D experience is accessible via [NFT Proof of Balance](https://github.com/VivaRado/NFT-Proof-of-Balance) by purchasing [$AEO](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xfd7ca4289770fba797957e37be66912fadce5d56). 


*  **Business Case** Components ∞0.001:
	1.  **Strategic case**
	1.  **Financial case**
	1.  **Management case**
		* Achievability

### **Strategic case**
<sub>Introduction / Phase Introduction / Initiation Phase / Business Case / Strategic case</sub>

<br>


The ability to have a set of simple looking instructions that reduce the repetitive nature of letters would increase the time spent on actually designing the look of the font and improve the time it takes to increase linguistic coverage and deploy the font. Most importantly you can still meddle with your font after the scripts are done doing what you told them.

#### AEO Proof of Balance NFT

</div>

[Minting this NFT](https://create.zora.co/collections/0xfd7ca4289770fba797957e37be66912fadce5d56) will serve as an access token to parts of the AEOLUM experience website, and helps with funding the development of the font and the tooling required to achieve that.


#### Github Sponsorship

We are also accepting sponsorships here on github.

### **Management case**
<sub>Introduction / Phase Introduction / Initiation Phase / Business Case / Management case</sub>

<br>


The management case tests the feasibility of the preferred option, in terms of its deliverability within various tolerances. 


#### Achievability:

We work around the product to achieve a smooth integration of all the parts, we have created [SYFF](https://github.com/VivaRado/SYFF) to help with combining letterforms in a distributed fashion that allows editability from files that look like CSS, we started developing the ThreeJS experience, the progress of which is on our [AEOLUM OpenSea collection](https://opensea.io/collection/aeolum), and we have managed to use [NFT Proof of Balance](https://github.com/VivaRado/NFT-Proof-of-Balance) as an access mechanism for said experience website. We think this will be a worth while journey for all of you who agree that this is a valid way to market, fund, develop type and type as art in line with web3 principles laid out in our [Digital Transformation booklet](https://opensea.io/collection/vrd) you can check that out on our [website](https://vivarado.com/api/metaverse?pack=en).

### **Planning Phase**
<sub>Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase</sub>

<br>


The Planning Phase, is where the project solution is further developed in as much detail as possible and the steps necessary to meet the project’s objectives.
The project's **Work Plan / Project Plan** is created outlining the activities, tasks, dependencies, and timeframes.

The Planning Phase consists of:

1. **Project Plan**:
1. **Work Plan**:
1. **Schedule Plan**:
1. **Stakeholders**
1. **Quality Plan (PQP)**


---



### **Project Plan**
<sub>Introduction / Phase Introduction / Planning Phase / Project Plan</sub>

<br>


Decide on the encoding sets and supported language scripts. Decide and plan the weights and how you will generate each weight. Understand the procedures and steps. Calculate or keep track of timelines, steps procedures and pitfalls.

A **Quality Plan** describes the activities, standards, tools and processes necessary to achieve quality in the delivery of a project.

We can now create a **Quality Plan** by identifying the valid **Quality Targets** we want to achieve. Identify the **Quality Policies** that will be required to achieve them. Identify how to do **Quality Measurement**. Lastly identify how to maintain quality with **Quality Management**.
